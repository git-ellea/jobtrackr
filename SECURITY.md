## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. 
Publicly disclosing a vulnerability can put user data at risk.

Instead, please report it through one of the following channels:
1. **Feedback Modal:** Use the built-in feedback system within the JobTrackr application.
2. **GitHub Private Message:** Contact the maintainer directly via GitHub.

We take security seriously and aim to respond to all reports within **48 hours**. 

Thank you for helping keep JobTrackr secure!
